## Our Project

For this project, we explored audio localization and speaker recognition with the goal of building a robot that identifies unique speaker locations and voices. For the purpose of audio localization, we learned how to calculate the angle of a speaker in relation to the robot, using the geometry of our two microphones and the time differences between the sound received by each of them. For the purpose of speaker recognition, we studied Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, vector quantization with K-means, and hidden Markov models to extract and analyze features of each personâ€™s voice.
